## Run service on localhost

- Default url [http://localhost:8002](http://localhost:8002)
- Swagger [http://localhost:8002/docs](http://localhost:8002/docs)

## Running the app locally on your OS

- You can run the app against your OS if you think it will be quicker development.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

- The other option would be to run it on docker which gets you an environment that is much closer to what runs in the remote environment. See below.
